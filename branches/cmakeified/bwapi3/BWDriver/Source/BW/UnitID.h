  /**
   * Representation of pointer to unit in bw structure that uses index (not
   * pointer). When pointer to another unit is present in bw structure, it uses
   * two ways to do it
   * 1) Pointer to bw memory where is the unit stored (in UnitNodeTable) This is
   *    used for example in Unit.next, this representation takes 4 bytes.
   * 2) unitIndes in the UnitNodeTable, this is used for example in Orders, the
   *    motivation probably was to save network data capacity, as only 2 bytes
   *    are needed to store the index. But for some unkown reason, value there
   *    is unit index + 1 << 11 (1 in the binary code on 11th place)
   *
   * Not using typedef to not accidentally imlicitely assign an index value
