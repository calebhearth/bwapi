#summary Plans for BWAPI 4.0
#labels Phase-Design

*_Note: These features are subject to change._*

= Custom Set Container =
  The addition of a custom set container to be used both internally and externally will increase the performance of both BWAPI and AI modules.

== The current implementation ==
  * High memory usage
    * _Allocates a new block of memory for each 32-bit element._
  * Slow
    * _Currently the bottleneck for obtaining a higher frame rate._
    * _Management is inefficient._
  * Incompatible
    * _With {{{_SECURE_SCL}}} disabled in an AI module, BWAPI will crash._

== The new implementation ==
  * Efficient
    * _Specifically designed for BWAPI usage to obtain the best performance possible._
  * Easier to use
    * _Higher level layers like UnitSet will allow easier management of several units, or the ability to use only a number of units that meet customizable requirements._
    * _Will be able to convert to some stl containers._

= Restructured Types =

== The current implementation ==
  * High memory usage for current amount of data
  * Incompatible with altered stats
    * _Mods_
    * _Use Map Settings_

== The new implementation ==
  * Uses constant global basic data types for data storage
    * _Faster data retrieval._
    * _No initialization of type information necessary for usage._
  * Retrieves altered type stats from Broodwar in initialization process.
    * _Does not override original data, which can be retrieved separately._
    * _Will allow AI to properly interact with Use Map Settings and mods._
  * Additional public enumeration for use with switch cases.
  * Alternative short, abbreviated, plural, and type names now available.
    * _Short names mostly used in modding AIScript._
    * _Abbreviated names mostly used in communication with other players._
