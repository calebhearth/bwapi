= Introduction =
  The BWAPI Winter Code tournament is a fun intermission tournament that allows both open and closed source bots to get together in a wide variety of ways and have fun while testing bot capabilities and limitations.

  The experimental tournament gives several other game types such as 2v2 and Use Map Settings a chance at becoming more popular for bots to play.

  Anyone can participate, as long as you are willing to run the Tournament module provided for this tournament.

  ==== Description ====
  Players control a single [UnitTypes#Terran_Wraith Wraith]. Initially, this wraith will repeatedly spawn a Scout that releases a barrage of missiles while the Wraith is being moved freely by the player. The Wraith must avoid touching enemy units or it will be destroyed. The objective is to clear all the enemies on the map. Over time you will gain "level ups" such as increasing the Scouts' spawn, causing more missiles to appear.
