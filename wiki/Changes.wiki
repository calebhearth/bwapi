Changes from BWAPI Beta 2 (r1400) to BWAPI Beta 2.1 (r1416):

  * Fixed a bug that produced phantom marines. An internal unit set in BWAPI was not being reset between matches, so units that existed in a previous match appeared to exist in the next game as phantom marines. Retrieving information from these non existant marines and/or issuing orders to them may have also caused Broodwar to crash.

  * [Game#leaveGame Game::leaveGame] - replaces Game::surrender and now works correctly.

Other changes:

  * Fixed crash due to null sprite pointer in Broodwar memory
  * Minor update of UnitType information for spells and Terran Nuclear Missile.
  * Minor update of description text shown in Chaoslauncher text box.
  * Example AI Module compiles much faster due to new compile of BWTA.lib.
