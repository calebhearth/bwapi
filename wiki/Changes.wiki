== Changes from BWAPI Beta 2.3 (r1610) to current revision (r1667): ==

  * Added [AttackType] class, however this won't be of much use until the Attack class is implemented (which will let AI Modules "see" projectiles, bullets, psi storms, lurker attacks, etc).
  * Added [Misc#TilePosition TilePosition] versions of [Game#buildable Game::buildable], [Game#visible Game::visible], [Game#hasCreep Game::hasCreep], and [Game#hasPower Game::hasPower].
  * Added [Unit#isBeingGathered Unit::isBeingGathered] - returns true for mineral patches and the three types of refineries when a unit is gathering from it.

The following functions have changed in functionality:

  * [UnitType#seekRange UnitType::seekRange] now returns the seek range in pixels.
  * [UnitType#sightRange UnitType::sightRange] now returns the sight range in pixels.
  * [UnitType#maxHitPoints UnitType::maxHitPoints] now returns actual max hit points (not multiplied by 256).
  * [Unit#getHitPoints Unit::getHitPoints] now returns actual current hit points (not multiplied by 256).
  * [Unit#getShields Unit::getShields] now returns actual current shields (not multiplied by 256).
  * [Unit#getEnergy Unit::getEnergy] now returns actual current energy (not multiplied by 256).
  * [UnitType#canAttack UnitType::canAttack] now returns false for overlords, dropships, and other types of units that cannot attack.
  * [Player#hasResearched Player::hasResearched] now returns true for abilities that the player has researched by default, such as Scanner Sweep.
  * [Game#getFrameCount Game::getFrameCount] now counts from 0. So the first frame is frame 0.

Bug fixes:

  * Fixed a bug where [Game#visible Game::visible] would crash the program when called during a replay.
  * Fixed a bug where [Unit#setRallyPosition Unit::setRallyPosition] and [Unit#setRallyUnit Unit::setRallyUnit] would not execute properly.
  * Fixed a bug where [Unit#patrol Unit::patrol] would appear to change the position of the unit to the target position.
  * Fixed [UnitType#topSpeed UnitType::topSpeed], [Unit#getVelocityX Unit::getVelocityX], and [Unit#getVelocityY Unit::getVelocityY]. Everything should now be in pixels per frame.
  * Fixed a bug where [Unit#isStartingAttack Unit::isStartingAttack] would always be false for certain types of units, even when they were attacking.
  * Fixed a bug where scanner sweep (and possibly other tech types that don't need to be researched) would not work.
  * Fixed a bug where [AIModule#onFrame AIModule::onFrame] would be called twice on the first frame.

== Changes from BWAPI Beta 2 (r1400) to BWAPI Beta 2.1 (r1416): ==
