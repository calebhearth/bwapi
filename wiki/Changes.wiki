== Changes from BWAPI Beta 2.5 (r1830) to current revision ==

  * Added [Unit#getLarva Unit::getLarva] - returns a set of 0, 1, 2, or 3 larva units that have spawned from the given Hatchery, Lair, or Hive.
  * Added [Unit#getHatchery Unit::getHatchery] - returns the Hatchery, Lair, or Hive that spawned the given larva. Returns NULL if the unit is not a Zerg Larva.
  * Added [Unit#returnCargo Unit::returnCargo] - returns the worker's cargo (minerals/gas) to a nearby resource depot. Works the same way as the "Return Cargo" button in the Starcraft GUI.
  * Added [Misc#Position Position::getApproxDistance] - an approximate distance function similar to the one starcraft uses.
  * Added [Player#isDefeated Player::isDefeated] - returns true if the player has been defeated
  * Added [Player#isVictorious Player::isVictorious] - returns true if the player has achieved victory.

The following functions have changed in functionality:

  * [AIModule#onEnd AIModule::onEnd] is now called before any user interaction at the end of games and replays.
  * [Game#getFrameCount Game::getFrameCount] no longer increases while the game is paused, however [AIModule#onFrame AIModule::onFrame] is still called.
  * [Unit#getRemainingTrainTime Unit::getRemainingTrainTime] now returns the number of frames until the next larva spawns at the given Hatchery, Lair, or Hive. Works as before on other unit types.
  * [Unit#getDistance Unit::getDistance(Unit* target)] now computes the distance between units more similar to the way starcraft computes distance between units when determining if a unit is in attack range.
  * [Unit#getDefenseMatrixPoints Unit::getDefenseMatrixPoints] now returns actual defense matrix hit points (not multiplied by 256).

Bug fixes:

  * Fixed a bug where [Game#canUpgrade Game::canUpgrade] would sometimes return true even though the player did not have enough resources.
  * Fixed a bug where [Unit#cancelTrain Unit::cancelTrain] would not cancel Terran Nuclear Missiles when called on a Terran Nuclear Missile Silo.
  * Fixed a bug where [Unit#isTraining Unit::isTraining] would return false when called on a Terran Nuclear Missile Silo training a Terran Nuclear Missile.
  * Fixed a bug where [Unit#getTrainingQueue Unit::getTrainingQueue] would return and empty list when called on a Terran Nuclear Missile Silo training a Terran Nuclear Missile.

== Changes from BWAPI Beta 2.4 (r1689) to BWAPI Beta 2.5 (r1830) ==

  * Added a logging option to bwapi.ini - by default it is set to off.
  * Added [TechType]::[TechType#getRace getRace] (the function was declared before but not actually implemented).
  * Added [Unit]::[Unit#getBuildType getBuildType] - returns the building type a worker is about to construct. If the unit is a morphing Zerg unit or an incomplete building, this returns the UnitType the unit is about to become upon completion.

  * Fixed TechTypes::Restoration.whatResearches() so that it now returns UnitTypes::Terran_Academy.
  * Fixed a bug where [Game]::[Game#canBuildHere canBuildHere] would return true even when a nexus/command center/hatchery was too close to invisible minerals/geysers. The function now uses static mineral and geyser data and assumes mineral fields exist unless it can see the build tile where the mineral is supposed to be, and cannot see the mineral unit.
  * Fixed a bug where [Unit]::[Unit#isIdle isIdle] would return false after a worker failed to start construction of a building.
  * Fixed a bug where using Siege Tanks would cause the game to crash.
  * Fixed a bug where BWAPI would crash on game end if a player left during the game.
  * Fixed a bug where [Unit]::[Unit#isGatheringGas isGatheringGas] would sometimes return false for drones harvesting gas into a morphing Hatchery.
  * Fixed a bug where chat messages in multiplayer games would either appear garbled or not show at all.

== Changes from BWAPI Beta 2.3 (r1610) to BWAPI Beta 2.4 (r1689): ==

  * Added [AttackType] class, however this won't be of much use until the Attack class is implemented (which will let AI Modules "see" projectiles, bullets, psi storms, lurker attacks, etc).
  * Added [Game#isExplored Game::isExplored] - returns true for tiles that are visible or were visible at some point earlier in the match.
  * Added [Unit#isBeingGathered Unit::isBeingGathered] - returns true for mineral patches and the three types of refineries when a unit is gathering from it.

  * Renamed Game::buildable to [Game#isBuildable Game::isBuildable]
  * Renamed Game::walkable to [Game#isWalkable Game::isWalkable]
  * Renamed Game::visible to [Game#isVisible Game::isVisible]
  * Renamed Game::groundHeight to [Game#getGroundHeight Game::getGroundHeight]
  * Added [Misc#TilePosition TilePosition] versions of [Game#isBuildable Game::isBuildable], [Game#isVisible Game::isVisible], [Game#hasCreep Game::hasCreep], and [Game#hasPower Game::hasPower].

  * [UnitType#seekRange UnitType::seekRange] now returns the seek range in pixels.
  * [UnitType#sightRange UnitType::sightRange] now returns the sight range in pixels.
  * [UnitType#maxHitPoints UnitType::maxHitPoints] now returns actual max hit points (not multiplied by 256).
  * [Unit#getHitPoints Unit::getHitPoints] now returns actual current hit points (not multiplied by 256).
  * [Unit#getShields Unit::getShields] now returns actual current shields (not multiplied by 256).
  * [Unit#getEnergy Unit::getEnergy] now returns actual current energy (not multiplied by 256).
  * [UnitType#canAttack UnitType::canAttack] now returns false for overlords, dropships, and other types of units that cannot attack.
  * [Player#hasResearched Player::hasResearched] now returns true for abilities that the player has researched by default, such as Scanner Sweep.
  * [Game#getFrameCount Game::getFrameCount] now counts from 0. So the first frame is frame 0.
  * [Game#sendText Game::sendText] now processes most cheat codes in single player games. For example, typing Broodwar->sendText("black sheep wall") will reveal the entire map.

Bug fixes:

  * Fixed a bug where [Game#isVisible Game::isVisible] would crash the program when called during a replay.
  * Fixed a bug where [Unit#setRallyPosition Unit::setRallyPosition] and [Unit#setRallyUnit Unit::setRallyUnit] would not execute properly.
  * Fixed a bug where [Unit#patrol Unit::patrol] would appear to change the position of the unit to the target position.
  * Fixed a bug where [Unit#isStartingAttack Unit::isStartingAttack] would always be false for certain types of units, even when they were attacking.
  * Fixed a bug where scanner sweep (and possibly other tech types that don't need to be researched) would not work.
  * Fixed a bug where [AIModule#onFrame AIModule::onFrame] would be called twice on the first frame.
  * Fixed a bug where [Unit#train Unit::train] would not allow more than one unit to be added to the training queue.
  * Fixed a bug where [AIModule#onUnitDestroy AIModule::onUnitDestroy] would not be called for units loaded into dropships/shuttles/overlords when the transport unit was destroyed.
  * Fixed [UnitType#topSpeed UnitType::topSpeed], [Unit#getVelocityX Unit::getVelocityX], and [Unit#getVelocityY Unit::getVelocityY]. Everything should now be in pixels per frame.
