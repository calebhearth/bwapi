BWAPI can automate most of the menus in the Starcraft GUI. The following options in the [http://code.google.com/p/bwapi/source/browse/trunk/bwapi/starcraft-folder/bwapi-data/bwapi.ini bwapi.ini] file specify how BWAPI automates the in-game menu system:

  * [#auto_menu auto_menu]
  * [#auto_restart auto_restart]
  * [#map map]
  * [#race race]
  * [#enemy_race enemy_race]
  * [#enemy_count enemy_count]
  * [#game_type game_type]

=== auto_menu ===
This specifies what mode the menu system is in. It can have one of the following values:
  * OFF - does no menu automation
  * SINGLE_PLAYER - goes to single player screen (also used for replays)
  * LAN_UDP - goes to LAN UDP screen
  * BATTLE_NET - goes to Battle Net login screen

If auto_menu is set to OFF, menu automation is disabled and none of the other options have any effect.

=== auto_restart ===

This specified what to do at the end of a match or replay. It can have one of the following values:
  * OFF - Does not automate the Victory/Defeat screen that appears after the end of the match. This lets you see the result of the match and also save the replay before starting the next match.
  * ON - Automates the Victory/Defeat screen, so BWAPI will proceed to the next match with no manual user input.

=== map ===
Specifies which map to play on, or which replays to watch. The path is relative to the Starcraft folder. If you wish to automate the process of joining a LAN UDP game, set auto_menu to LAN_UDP and set map to nothing (i.e. "map = ").

Examples:

  * map = maps\(2)Boxer.scm
  * map = maps\BroodWar\WebMaps\(8)Big Game Hunters.scm
  * map = maps\replays\LastReplay.rep

=== race ===
Specifies which race to select for the player. Can have one of the following values:
  * Terran
  * Protoss
  * Zerg
  * Random

=== enemy_race ===
Specifies which race to select for the computer opponents. This option is only used in single player games - currently no computer opponents are automatically added to LAN UDP games. Can have one of the following values:
  * Terran
  * Protoss
  * Zerg
  * Random

=== enemy_count ===
Specifies the number of computer opponents to add to the game. This option is only used in single player games - currently no computer opponents are automatically added to LAN UDP games. Must be a value between 1 and 7. If the map does not have enough slots for the given number of computer opponents, then BWAPI uses the maximum number possible. For example, if you try to specify 7 computer opponents on a 3 player map, only 2 opponents will be in the game.

=== game_type ===
Specifies the GameType. Sub-type selection is not implemented at this time (add an issue if you want to see it added), so there is limited support for Team Melee, and several other game types which use game sub-type options. Can have one of the following values:

  * TOP_VS_BOTTOM
  * MELEE
  * FREE_FOR_ALL
  * ONE_ON_ONE
  * USE_MAP_SETTINGS
  * CAPTURE_THE_FLAG
  * GREED
  * SLAUGHTER
  * SUDDEN_DEATH
  * TEAM_MELEE
  * TEAM_FREE_FOR_ALL
  * TEAM_CAPTURE_THE_FLAG
