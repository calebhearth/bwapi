The UnitType class is used to get information about a particular type of unit, such as the build time of a Lurker, or the mineral price of an Ultralisk.

Table of all [UnitTypes] (along with some stat info obtained via BWAPI).

= Methods =

== getID ==
int getID() const;

Returns a unique ID for this unit type.

== getName ==
std::string getName() const;

Returns the name of the unit.

== getRace ==
[Race] getRace() const;

Returns the race that the unit belongs to. For example UnitTypes::Terran_SCV.getRace() will return Races::Terran.

== whatBuilds ==
const std::pair< [UnitType], int > whatBuilds() const;

Returns what builds this unit type. The second number will usually be 1 unless the unit type is Protoss_Archon or Protoss_Dark_Archon. Units that cannot be created, such as critters and mineral fields, will return a pair where the unit type is UnitTypes::None, and the second component is 0.

Example: UnitTypes::Terran_Marine.whatBuilds() will return an std::pair, where the first component is UnitTypes::Terran_Barracks.

== requiredUnits ==
const std::map< [UnitType], int > requiredUnits() const;

Returns the units the player is required to have before it can train or build the given unit type. In addition to having the required units, the player must also have sufficient minerals, gas, and the [UnitType#requiredTech requiredTech] (if any).

Example: UnitTypes::Terran_Battlecruiser.requiredUnits() will return a map of three keys: UnitTypes::Terran_Starport, UnitTypes::Terran_Control_Tower, and UnitTypes::Terran_Physics_Lab.

== requiredTech ==
[TechType] requiredTech() const;

Included in the API for completeness, since the only units that actually needs tech to be trained are the Zerg_Lurker and Zerg_Lurker_Egg. The tech type needed is TechTypes::Lurker_Aspect.

== cloakingTech ==
[TechType] cloakingTech() const;

Returns the Tech type used for cloaking the unit, or TechTypes::None if the unit does not have the cloak ability or is permanently cloaked.

== abilities ==
const std::set< [TechType] >& abilities() const;

Returns the set of tech types this unit can use, provided the tech types have been researched and the unit has enough energy.

== upgrades ==
const std::set< [UpgradeType] >& upgrades() const;

Returns the set of upgrade types that can affect this unit.

== armorUpgrade ==
[UpgradeType] armorUpgrade() const;

Returns the upgrade that increase's the unit's armor, or UpgradeTypes::None if no upgrade increase's this unit's armor. For example UnitTypes::Terran_Marine.armorUpgrade() will return a pointer to UpgradeTypes::Terran_Infantry_Armor.

== maxHitPoints ==
int maxHitPoints() const;

Returns the maximum amount of hit points the unit type can have.

== maxShields ==
int maxShields() const;

Returns the maximum amount of shields the unit type can have.

int gasPrice() const;

Returns the gas price of the unit. Example: UnitTypes::Siege_Tank_Tank_Mode.gasPrice() returns 100.

== supplyProvided ==
int supplyProvided() const;

Returns the amount of supply produced by this unit (i.e. for a Protoss_Pylon). Supply counts returned by BWAPI are double what you would expect to see from playing the game. This is because zerglings take up 0.5 in-game supply.

== spaceProvided ==
int spaceProvided() const;

Returns the amount of space this unit type provides.

== buildScore ==
int buildScore() const;

Returns the score which is used to determine the total scores in the after-game stats screen.

== size ==
[UnitSizeType] size() const;

Returns the size of the unit - either Small, Medium, Large, or Independent.

== tileWidth ==
