The four tiers of accessibility:

== 1) Full Accessibility ==

All of units owned by the BWAPI player/AI are fully accessible all of the time while they are alive. If the Complete Map Information flag is enabled, or if the match is a replay, then all of the units in the match will be fully accessible, not just the units owned by [Game#self self()]. Otherwise, the neutral and enemy units will fall into one of the remaining tiers of accessibility.

== 2) Normal Accessibility ==

When complete map information is disabled, then all visible and detected enemy units will have normal accessibility. This includes all of the attributes in full accessibility except for the following:

  * getScarabCount
  * getSpiderMineCount
  * getBuildType
  * getTrainingQueue
  * getTech
  * getUpgrade
  * getRemainingBuildTime
  * getRemainingTrainTime
  * getRemainingResearchTime
  * getRemainingUpgradeTime
  * getRallyPosition
  * getRallyUnit
  * getTransport
  * getCarrier
  * getHatchery
  * hasNuke
  * isHallucination

== 3) Partial Accessibility ==

Units that return true for [Unit#isVisible Unit::isVisible] but false for [Unit#isDetected Unit::isDetected] are partially accessible.

Partial accessibility includes access to the following functions:
  * [Unit#getID getID]
  * [Unit#getPlayer getPlayer]
  * [Unit#getType getType]
  * [Unit#getPosition getPosition]
  * [Unit#getTilePosition getTilePosition]
  * [Unit#getAngle getAngle]
  * [Unit#getVelocityX getVelocityX]
  * [Unit#getVelocityY getVelocityY]
  * [Unit#getDistance getDistance]
  * [Unit#getGroundWeaponCooldown getGroundWeaponCooldown]
  * [Unit#getAirWeaponCooldown getAirWeaponCooldown]
  * [Unit#getSpellCooldown getSpellCooldown]
  * [Unit#exists exists]
  * [Unit#isAttacking isAttacking]
  * [Unit#isBurrowed isBurrowed]
  * [Unit#isCloaked isCloaked]
  * [Unit#isCompleted isCompleted]
  * [Unit#isDetected isDetected] - returns false
  * [Unit#isMoving isMoving]
  * [Unit#isSieged isSieged]
  * [Unit#isStartingAttack isStartingAttack]
  * [Unit#isVisible isVisible] - returns true

The initial value functions are also still accessible at this level, however I don't think its possible for neutral units (like mineral patches) to cloak, so think they would be of any use here.

Note: [AIModule#onUnitShow AIModule::onUnitShow] and [AIModule#onUnitHide AIModule::onUnitHide] occur when the unit switches between partial accessibility and no accessibility.

== 4) No Accessibility ==

Units that are dead will have no accessibility. If Complete Map Info is disabled, then units shrouded by Fog of War will also have no accessibility, even if they are still alive.

The initial value functions, however, are always accessible at all levels:
  * getInitialType
  * getInitialPosition
  * getInitialTilePosition
  * getInitialHitPoints
  * getInitialResources

These only apply for neutral units that existed at the start of the match are are useful for getting general/static knowledge of the map even when complete map info is disabled. To obtain this static map info use these functions on the units returned by:
  * [Game#getStaticMinerals Game::getStaticMinerals]
  * [Game#getStaticGeysers Game::getStaticGeysers]
  * [Game#getStaticNeutralUnits Game::getStaticNeutralUnits]
