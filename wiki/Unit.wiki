The Unit class is used to get information about individual units as well as issue orders to units.

Methods:

  * [#getOwner getOwner]
  * [#getType getType]
  * [#health health]
  * [#shield shield]
  * [#energy energy]
  * [#getKillCount getKillCount]
  * [#getPosition getPosition]
  * [#getTilePosition getTilePosition]

  * [#getTarget getTarget]
  * [#getTargetPosition getTargetPosition]
  * [#getOrder getOrder]
  * [#getOrderTarget getOrderTarget]
  * [#getOrderTimer getOrderTimer]
  * [#getSecondaryOrder getSecondaryOrder]
  * [#getBuildUnit getBuildUnit]
  * [#getRemainingBuildTime getRemainingBuildTime]
  * [#getChild getChild]

  * [#isAccelerating isAccelerating]
  * [#isBeingHealed isBeingHealed]
  * [#isBlind isBlind]
  * [#isBraking isBraking]
  * [#isBurrowed isBurrowed]

  * [#isSelected isSelected]
  * [#isSieged isSieged]
  * [#isStartingAttack isStartingAttack]
  * [#isTraining isTraining]

The following orders can be issued to units:
  * [#attackMove attackMove] - Attack move to a position
  * [#attackUnit attackUnit] - Attack a specific unit
  * [#rightClick rightClick] - Right click on a position
  * [#rightClick_2 rightClick] - Right click on a unit

  * [#invent research]
  * [#upgrade upgrade]
  * [#stop stop]
  * [#holdPosition holdPosition]
  * [#patrol patrol]
  * [#burrow burrow]
  * [#unburrow unburrow]
  * [#siege siege]
  * [#unsiege unsiege]
  * [#cloak cloak]
  * [#decloak decloak]
  * [#lift lift]
  * [#land land]

The following orders have not been implemented yet:
  * [#load load]
  * [#unload unload]
  * [#unloadAll unloadAll]
  * [#unloadAll_2 unloadAll]
  * [#useTech useTech]
  * [#useTech_2 useTech]
