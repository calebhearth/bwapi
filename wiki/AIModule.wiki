AIModule is a virtual class that is intended to be implemented or inherited by a custom AI class. The following callbacks available to AIs:

  * [#onStart onStart]
  * [#onEnd onEnd]
  * [#onFrame onFrame]
  * [#onSendText onSendText]
  * [#onRemoveUnit onRemoveUnit]

=== onStart ===
void onStart();

BWAPI calls this at the start of a match. Typically an AI will execute set up code in this method (initialize data structures, load build orders, etc).

=== onEnd ===
void onEnd();

BWAPI calls this at the end of the match.

=== onFrame ===
void onFrame();

BWAPI calls this on every logical frame in the game.

=== onSendText ===
bool onSendText(std::string text);

if [Misc#Flag Flag]::UserInput is enabled, BWAPI will call this each time a user enters a message into the chat.

=== onRemoveUnit ===
void onRemoveUnit([Unit]{{{*}}} unit);

BWAPI calls this when a unit dies.

BWAI currently executes most of its logic in the onFrame callback, however it may be possible to create a new thread in the onStart method and execute your AI asynchronously (has not been tested yet).
