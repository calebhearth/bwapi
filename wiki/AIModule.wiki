= AIModule =

AIModule is a virtual class that is intended to be implemented or inherited by a custom AI class. The following callbacks available to AIs:

  * void onStart();
  * void onEnd();
  * void onFrame();
  * bool onSendText(std::string text);
  * void onRemoveUnit(Unit{{{*}}} unit);

BWAI currently executes most of its logic in the onFrame callback, however it may be possible to create a new thread in the onStart method and execute your AI asynchronously (has not been tested yet).
