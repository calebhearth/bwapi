= Todo list for release 1.0 =

== Complete interface functionality ==

  * [Unit]::[Unit#isVisible isVisible] - needs proper implementation, currently just uses heuristics. Did an exhaustive search of all bits in the unit, and none of them indicate visibility, so I think broodwar does not store visibility information anywhere.

We could use [http://code.google.com/p/bwapi/source/browse/trunk/bwapi/BWAPI/Source/BW/UnitStatusFlags.h StatusFlags]::RequiresDetection and check the distances and detection radius of each detector unit. Detector unit types (with detection ranges according to [http://starcraft.wikia.com] )
  * Terran_Science_Vessel: 10
  * Terran_Missile_Turret: 11
  * Spell_Scanner_Sweep: 10
  * Zerg_Overlord: 9 (11 upgraded)
  * Zerg_Spore_Colony: 10
  * Protoss_Observer: 9 (11 upgraded)
  * Protoss_Photon_Cannon: 7

  * [UnitType]::abilities - returns the set of tech types this unit type can use (via useTech). Opposite of [TechType]::whatUses.

  * [UpgradeType]::maxRepeats

  * [Player]::[Player#isAlliesWith isAlliesWith]
  * [Game]::[Game#getLatency getLatency] - right now just set to BattlenetLow in constructor.

  * [Game]::setScreenPosition(int x, int y)

  * Pylon power range - add to Constants.h. May have a different radius for horizontal and vertical (since it looks like an ellipse in-game). After some experimentation, the range does not appear to be either horizontally or vertically symmetric. For example, the range extends a few tiles farther toward the top left. May need to make 3 relative build maps, for 2x2, 2x3, and 3x4 sized buildings to determine exactly where each can be placed, relative to a pylon.

  * [Game]::surrender
  * Determine when BWAPI is in a single player game (not network game or replay)
  * Make [Game]::printPublic work in single player. Once this works we can remove [Game]::print and rename [Game]::printPublic to [Game]::print.
  * [Game]::text(int x, int y, const char{{{*}}} text, ...) - print at arbitrary screen location

= Possible Ideas for release 1.x =

  * Order call-backs and/or buffering so the AI module can "listen" to what orders are being issued.
