Methods that need to be implemented:
  * [Unit]::cancelMorph
  * [Unit]::cancelTrain - (cancel last)
  * [Unit]::cancelTrain - (cancel unit at specified index in training list)
  * [Unit]::cancelAddon

  * [Unit]::getRallyPosition - might be stored as the target position of the building.
  * [Unit]::getRallyUnit - might be stored as the target unit of the building.

  * [Unit]::removeTimer

  * [Unit]::isBeingHealed - implemented, but function unknown

  * Replace [Unit]::[Unit#isDisabled isDisabled] with:
  * [Unit]::isUnpowered - StatusFlags::Disabled (unverified)

  * [Unit]::[Unit#isVisible isVisible] - needs proper implementation, currently just uses heuristics. Did an exhaustive search of all bits in the unit, and none of them indicate visibility, so I think broodwar does not store visibility information anywhere, and instead just calculates it while rendering.

We could use [http://code.google.com/p/bwapi/source/browse/trunk/bwapi/BWAPI/Source/BW/UnitStatusFlags.h StatusFlags]::RequiresDetection and check the distances and detection radius of each detector unit. Detector unit types (with detection ranges according to [http://starcraft.wikia.com] )
