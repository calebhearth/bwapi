= Todo list for release 1.0 =

== Complete interface functionality ==

  * [Unit]::[Unit#isVisible isVisible] - needs proper implementation, currently just uses heuristics. Did an exhaustive search of all bits in the unit, and none of them indicate visibility, so I think broodwar does not store visibility information anywhere. We could use [http://code.google.com/p/bwapi/source/browse/trunk/bwapi/BWAPI/Source/BW/UnitStatusFlags.h StatusFlags]::RequiresDetection and check the distances and detection radius of each detector unit.

== Enforce CompleteMapInformation cheat flag ==
  * Player methods
  * Unit methods

== Make BWAPI thread safe ==
  * Game methods
  * Player methods
  * Unit methods (information)
  * Unit methods (orders)

== Implement Error Code Usage ==
  * Game methods
  * Player methods
  * Unit methods

= Possible Ideas for release 1.x =

  * Order call-backs and/or buffering so the AI module can "listen" to what orders are being issued.
  * [Game]::setScreenPosition(int x, int y)
