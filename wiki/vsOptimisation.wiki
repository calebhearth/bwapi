IN progress - I will finish it soon after I test more things

Everyone can add here advices how to set up the visual studio well

I just found there is service pack 1 for visual studio, so make sure you install it.

==Speed up VS==
#Options->Environment->Startup Set startup to "Load last loaded solution" so the shitty startup page wont load everytime
 # Options->Envioronment->General set recent files to 1/1
 # Options->Envioronment->General set Animate environmental tools to OFF
 # Disable HTML validation - Tools\Options\Text Editor\HTML\Validation\   uncheck "Show Errors" checkbox

==Spped up work==

# Be sure you have "go to definition" and "go to declaration" shortucts set ( I use alt-d, alt-s)
 # Have some way to switch between header and cpp file (I use some macro but it has some drawback, looking for better way)
 # Use the Open file function (It opens the file you have cursor on mostly #inlcude, I have it on ctrl-enter (as it had borland) 
 # Looking for some addon that would open dialog box, I would write file name and it would open it (with tooltip))

==Test stuff==
 # Refactor pro seems to be nice, but I need to test it more properly, seems to be full of bugs
