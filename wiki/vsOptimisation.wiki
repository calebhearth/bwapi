My tests result is that Visual studio 2005 is much quicker in many ways, so you can still use 2008 if you have only the express edition, but 2005 is probably better choise now, especially if you have these performance issues I had.

So I made the project to support both vs 2005 and 2008, every project file with suffix 2005 relates to visual studio 2005.

VS 2005 is starting 13 seconds, while vs 2008 36.

=== Visual studio 2008  ===
I just found there is service pack 1 for visual studio, so make sure you install it.


=== Visual studio 2005/2008  ===
== Addins ==
 # Ankh Integrated SVN support http://bwapi.googlecode.com/files/AnkhSetup-1.0.3.2800-Trunk.msi

==Speed up VS==
#Options->Environment->Startup Set startup to "Load last loaded solution" so the shitty startup page wont load everytime
 # Options->Envioronment->General set recent files to 1/1
 # Options->Envioronment->General set Animate environmental tools to OFF
 # Disable HTML validation - Tools\Options\Text Editor\HTML\Validation\   uncheck "Show Errors" checkbox

==Speed up work==
# Be sure you have "go to definition" and "go to declaration" shortucts set ( I use alt-d, alt-s)
 # Have some way to switch between header and cpp file (I use the swap.hpp/cpp feature from kings tools, but it is only for vs 2005)
 # Use the Open file function (It opens the file you have cursor on mostly #inlcude, I have it on ctrl-enter (as it had borland) 
 # Looking for some addon that would open dialog box, I would write file name and it would open it (with tooltip))

==Test stuff==
 # Refactor pro seems to be nice, but I need to test it more properly, seems to be full of bugs
=== Visual studio 2005 ==
 # King tools http://bwapi.googlecode.com/files/KingsSetup.msi
