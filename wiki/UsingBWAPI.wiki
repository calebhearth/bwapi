To program AIs using BWAPI you will need to have the following installed:
  * [http://www.blizzard.com/us/broodwar/ Starcraft: Broodwar] [http://us.blizzard.com/support/article.xml?locale=en_US&articleId=21149 1.16.1]
  * [http://www.teamliquid.net/forum/viewmessage.php?topic_id=65196 Chaoslauncher]
  * A C++ compiler (such as Visual Studio 2008 [http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=FBEE1648-7106-44A7-9649-6D9F6D58056E&displaylang=en SP1] or [http://www.microsoft.com/express/download/#webInstall Visual C++ 2008 Express Edition])

Once you have those, download [http://bwapi.googlecode.com/files/BWAPI_Beta_2.0.2.zip BWAPI Beta 2] and follow the instructions in the readme on how to build the example AI module. It will explain where to place files and how to compile a sort of "Hello World"-like AI Module for BWAPI, which you can work from to start making your own custom Broodwar AI.

Once you understand how the Example AI Module works, feel free to download the [http://code.google.com/p/bwsal/downloads/list Basic AI Module] from the [http://code.google.com/p/bwsal/ BWSAL project], which aims to develop several add-ons for BWAPI that will be useful for a wide variety of AIs.
