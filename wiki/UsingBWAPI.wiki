To program AIs using BWAPI you will need to have the following installed:
  * [http://www.blizzard.com/us/broodwar/ Starcraft: Broodwar] [http://us.blizzard.com/support/article.xml?locale=en_US&articleId=21149 1.16.1]
  * [http://www.teamliquid.net/forum/viewmessage.php?topic_id=65196 Chaoslauncher]
  * A C++ compiler (such as Visual Studio 2008 [http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=FBEE1648-7106-44A7-9649-6D9F6D58056E&displaylang=en SP1] or [http://www.microsoft.com/express/download/#webInstall Visual C++ 2008 Express Edition])

Once you have those, download the [http://bwapi.googlecode.com/files/Example_AI_Module_3.0.1.zip Example AI Module 3.0.1] and follow the instructions in the readme after you extract the zip. It will explain where to place files and how to compile a sort of "Hello World"-like AI Module for BWAPI, which you can work from to start making your own custom Broodwar AI.

If you are using a compiler other than Visual Studio, you will need to copy the contents of Example_AI_Module_1.2/include to your compiler's include directory, copy Example_AI_Module_1.2/lib/BWAPI.lib to your compiler's lib directory, and link with BWAPI.lib. You should configure your project to compile as a dll. Currently no other compilers/IDEs are supported, but I hope to eventually get it working in an open source IDE such as [http://www.codeblocks.org/home Code::Blocks] - currently the dll compiled with it crashes Broodwar at run time.

== Known Issues ==
  * If you try to make a UMS game, the game crashes. We haven't tried to make BWAPI work on other game modes yet so for now try to stick to Melee or Free for All.
