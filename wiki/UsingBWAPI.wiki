To program AIs using BWAPI you will need to have the following installed:
  * Broodwar 1.16.1
  * Chaoslauncher
  * A C++ compiler (such as Visual Studio 2008)

Once you have those, download the [http://bwapi.googlecode.com/files/Example_AI_Module_1.2.zip Example AI Module] and follow the instructions in the readme after you extract the zip. It will explain where to place files and how to compile a sort of "Hello World"-like AI Module for BWAPI, which you can work from to start making your own custom Broodwar AI.

If you are using a compiler other than Visual Studio, you will need to copy the contents of Example_AI_Module_1.2/include to your compiler's include directory, copy Example_AI_Module_1.2/lib/BWAPI.lib to your compiler's lib directory, and link with BWAPI.lib. You should configure your project to compile as a dll.
