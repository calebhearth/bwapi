To program AIs using BWAPI you will need to have the following installed:
  * [http://www.blizzard.com/us/broodwar/ Starcraft: Broodwar] [http://us.blizzard.com/support/article.xml?locale=en_US&articleId=21149 1.16.1]
  * [http://www.teamliquid.net/forum/viewmessage.php?topic_id=65196 Chaoslauncher]
  * A C++ compiler (such as Visual Studio 2008 [http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=FBEE1648-7106-44A7-9649-6D9F6D58056E&displaylang=en SP1] or [http://www.microsoft.com/express/download/#webInstall Visual C++ 2008 Express Edition])

Once you have those, download the [http://bwapi.googlecode.com/files/Example_AI_Module_4.0.1.zip Example AI Module 4.0.1] and follow the instructions in the readme after you extract the zip. It will explain where to place files and how to compile a sort of "Hello World"-like AI Module for BWAPI, which you can work from to start making your own custom Broodwar AI.

Once you understand how the Example AI Module works, feel free to download the [http://code.google.com/p/bwsal/downloads/list Basic AI Module] from the [http://code.google.com/p/bwsal/ BWSAL project], which aims to develop several add-ons for BWAPI that will be useful for a wide variety of AIs.

== Known Issues ==
  * If you try to make a UMS game, the game crashes. We haven't tried to make BWAPI work on other game modes yet so for now try to stick to Melee or Free for All.
