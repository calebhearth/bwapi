Disabling CPU Throttling will increase performance but will increase CPU usage.

= Change Game Speed =

Typing {{{ /speed 0 }}} in Starcraft will disable the delay between frames. You can perform the same action from an AI module by calling the function [Game#setLocalSpeed Game::setLocalSpeed(0)].

= Disable the GUI =
  http://bwapi.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/speed_tut_04.gif

Typing {{{ /nogui }}} in Starcraft will toggle the display of graphics. Disabling the Graphical User Interface (GUI) will prevent Starcraft from calling its drawing routines and image processing functions. The same action can be performed from an AI module by calling the function [Game#setGUI Game::setGUI(false)].
