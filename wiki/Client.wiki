Class header file: [http://code.google.com/p/bwapi/source/browse/trunk/bwapi/include/BWAPI/Client/Client.h# BWAPI/Client/Client.h]

The Client class manages the connection between a BWAPI client program and the BWAPI server running in BWAPI.dll. For examples of how to use this class please see the Example AI Client and the AI Module Loader that are included in the latest release of BWAPI.

The BWAPIClient.lib library contains the implementation of the Client class along with classes which implement the [Game], [Force], [Player], and [Unit] interfaces.

Methods:

  * [#isConnected isConnected]
  * [#connect connect]
  * [#disconnect disconnect]
  * [#update update]

=== isConnected ===
bool isConnected();

Returns true if the client is currently connected to the server.

=== connect ===
bool connect();

Attempts to connect the client to the server. If it succeeds, it returns true. If Starcraft/BWAPI is not yet running, this will fail and return false.

=== disconnect ===
void disconnect();

Disconnects the client from the server.

=== update ===
void update();

Tells the server to process commands sent from the client and proceed to the next frame in the game and then it processes new information obtained from the server.
