Class header file: [http://code.google.com/p/bwapi/source/browse/trunk/bwagent/source/BWAPI/BWAPI.h BWAPI/BWAPI.h]

BWAPI1 is a native C style API. Native APIs are timeless, being the most basic API choise in windows. It is not object oriented.

BWAPI1 is designed as a data query interface only. This is why BWAPI1 functions do not return the data directly, but pointers to structures which are filled with data. Use BWAPI1 only if your AI uses only it's own algorithms and wants to avoid the per-frame overhead of BWAPI2 algorithms.

Methods:

  * [#BWGetVersion BWGetVersion]
  * [#BWConnect BWConnect]
  * [#BWGetLastError BWGetLastError]

=== BWGetVersion ===
int BWGetVersion();

Returns the SVN-revision number of the BWAgent.dll you're using.

The header-file version should always be checked at startup of your AI.exe to match the BWAgent.dll version. In the header files, the version is defined as SVN_REV.

Example:
{{{
if(BWGetVersion() != SVN_REV)
{
  printf("Wrong BWAgent.dll version\n");
  exit(1);
}
}}}

=== BWConnect ===
bool BWConnect();

Searches for a running Starcraft instance with a loaded BWAPI plugin and, if found, attempts to connect.
Returns false if no connection was established. Feel free to try again later.
Returns true if connected successfully.

Example:
{{{
if(!BWConnect())
{
  printf("Waiting for Starcraft to startup.\n");
  while(!BWConnect())
  {
    // retry every second
    Sleep(1000);
  }
}
printf("Connected.\n");
}}}

=== BWGetLastError ===
const char{{{*}}} BWGetLastError();

returns a string describing the error of the last BWAPI1 function call. call this immediately after a failed BWAPI1 function call, because the next BWAPI1 function call will overwrite the last error.
