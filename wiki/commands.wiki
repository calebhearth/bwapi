This list has been merged due to the similarity between Replay data and Packet data.

The command opcode is not stored in the Command ID of the packet, but rather in the data, where many commands may stack.
Command class 1 opcodes are typically those from ~0x37 to ~0x50.


See http://code.google.com/p/vgce/wiki/starcraftCommands for updated list.
