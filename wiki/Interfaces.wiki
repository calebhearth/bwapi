#summary Explanation of the different interfaces in BWAPI
#labels Featured

This page aims to clarify naming/terminology of the BWAPI project and it's interfaces for the upcoming release v3.0 (or BWAPIv3 for short, note the "v"). There have been 
understandable confusion lately.

  * [#BWAPI2 BWAPI2]
  * [#BWAPI1 BWAPI1]
  * [#Bridge (Shared Memory) Bridge]

==BWAPI2==
*Explanation*:
This is the interface that was provided in BWAPI versions prior v3 (or BWAPIv2.x for short). It is a very easy to use, clearly structured and object oriented interface which also provides some basic features. It has a shallow learning curve in case you do not know C++ xor Broodwar. For those who worked with BWAPIv2.x, yes it is be compatible with your code, it's the same old interface you know and love. Why rename it to BWAPI2 then? Because BWAPI1 is a much more basic, low-level and feature less. BWAPI2 is internally based on BWAPI1 so it would be irrational to call them any other way.

*Technical*:
The C++ namespace is now called "BWAPI2". (In BWAPIv2.x it was called "BWAPI").
The BWAPI2 Interface is provided by BWAPI2.dll, which is loaded just like a regular library:

If you use BWTA or other libraries, it looks like this:

Do not delude yourself, using more .dlls does not lead to overhead using BWAPI.

==BWAPI1==
*Explanation*:
This is a new interface exposed by the BWAPI project since BWAPIv3. This interface does _not_ have more features, in fact, it has much less. Designed minimalistic and is dedicated to developing specialised, high performance AIs in C++. BWAPI1 is itself not object oriented (rather data-oriented). For more information see ModularDesign. BWAPI1 is internally based on the Bridge concept.

*Technical*:
The C++ namespace is called "BWAPI".
To use BWAPI1 you use BWAgent.dll directly:

The performance gain does not come from directly using BWAgent.dll, but from BWAPI1 being tightly based on the bridge concept. In a nutshell, BWAPI1 does not provide functions for querying gamestate. Instead it returns pointers for you to random access whatever data you need. Issuing orders in BWAPI1 does not have performance advantages over BWAPI2.

==Bridge==
*Explanation*:
This is a concept that caused the major revision change to 3, because it changed the whole internal design of the project. For AI developers, the bridge is transparent. The only change from BWAPIv2.x you will experience is: AIs are not loaded as .dll files anymore, but are run in a separate process as executables. The biggest advantages are:
  * it makes debugging easier
  * for competitons based on the BWAPI project, this is the first step to prevent cheating
*Technical*:
The bridge is a shared memory interprocess communication means between the Starcraft and AI processes. The BWAPI1 interface is based on the bridge implementation. If you are a developer (or just nosey) see BridgeMechanics. Where it all started: issue 134.
