#summary Explanation of the different interfaces in BWAPI
#labels Featured

This page aims to clarify naming/terminology of the BWAPI project and it's interfaces for the upcoming release v3.0 (or BWAPIv3 for short, note the "v"). There have been 
understandable confusion lately. For information on how to use the interfaces, see [UsingBWAPI].

  * [#BWSL BWSL]
  * [#BWAPI BWAPI]
  * [#Bridge (Shared Memory) Bridge]

==BWSL==
*Explanation*:
BWSL (BroodWar Standard Library) is a feature library. Based on BWAPI, it provides an interface that can be used completely independent from BWAPI. BWSL is easy to use, fully object oriented and provides a good deal of generally usefull functionality, ideal to jumpstart your AI development. It has a shallow learning curve.

*Porting from BWAPIv2.6.1*:
For those who worked with BWAPI versions 2.x, the interface of BWSL is compatible with your code. It's the same old interface you know and love. It moved to BWSL because in the major revision, the project became more modular. The former BWAPI Interface is forked into the BWSL library (to hold the features) and BWAPI interface (to expose the pure API). BWSL is based on BWAPI.

*Technical*:
The C++ namespace of the library is called "BWSL". The BWSL Interface is provided by BWSL.dll, which is loaded just like a regular library:

If you use BWTA or other libraries, then the dependency graph looks like this:

==BWAPI==
*Explanation*:
This is the basic interface exposed by the BWAPI project since version 3.0. BWAPI (BroodWar Application Programming Interface) is an inteface for querying data and issuing orders in its most basic form. Itself it does not have any nontrivial functionality (to improve modularity) and includes a few modules to help implement the most common tasks. This way there is no overhead the AI did not ask for and very high performance can be achieved. BWAPI is itself not object oriented (rather data-oriented). For more information see ModularDesign. BWAPI is internally based on the Bridge concept.

*Technical*:
The C++ namespace is called "BWAPI".
To use BWAPI you use BWAgent.dll directly:

The performance gain does not come from directly using BWAgent.dll, but from BWAPI being tightly based on the bridge concept. In a nutshell, BWAPI does not provide functions for querying gamestate nor does it have per frame overhead of any sort. It only returns pointers for you to random access whatever data you need. Issuing orders in BWAPI does not have performance advantages over BWSL.

==Bridge==
*Explanation*:
This is a concept that caused the major revision change to 3, because it changed the whole internal design of the project. For AI developers, the bridge is transparent. The only change from BWAPI version 2.x you will experience is: AIs are not loaded as .dll files anymore, but are run in a separate process as executables. The biggest advantages are:
  * it makes debugging easier
  * for competitons based on the BWAPI project, this is the first step to prevent cheating
*Technical*:
The bridge is a shared memory interprocess communication means between the Starcraft and AI processes. The BWAPI interface is tightly based on the bridge implementation. If you are a developer (or just nosey) see BridgeMechanics. Where it all started: issue 134.
