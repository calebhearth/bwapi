bool isEnemy([Player]{{{*}}} player) const;

Returns true if other player is an enemy of this player.

=== isNeutral ===
bool isNeutral() const;

Returns true if the player is the neutral player.

=== getStartLocation ===
[Misc#TilePosition TilePosition] getStartLocation() const;

Returns the starting location of the player. For the complete set of starting locations for the current map, see [Game]::[Game#getStartLocations getStartLocations].

=== minerals ===
int minerals() const;

Returns the amount of minerals the player has.

=== supplyTotal ===
int supplyTotal() const;

int supplyTotal(Race race) const;

Returns the total amount of supply the player has. If a race is provided, the total supply for the given race will be returned, otherwise the player's initial race will be used.

int supplyUsed() const;

int supplyUsed(Race race) const;

Returns how much of the supply is actually being used by units. If a race is provided, the used supply for the given race will be returned, otherwise the player's initial race will be used. Supply counts returned by BWAPI are double what you would expect to see from playing the game. This is because zerglings take up 1/2 supply.

=== allUnitCount ===
int allUnitCount([UnitType] type) const;

Returns the number of all units of the given type.

=== completedUnitCount ===
int completedUnitCount([UnitType] type) const;

Returns the number of completed units of the given type.

=== incompleteUnitCount ===
int incompleteUnitCount([UnitType] type) const;

Returns the number of incomplete units of the given type. 

=== deadUnitCount ===
int deadUnitCount([UnitType] unit) const;

Returns the number of dead units of the given type.

=== isResearching ===
bool isResearching([TechType] tech) const;
