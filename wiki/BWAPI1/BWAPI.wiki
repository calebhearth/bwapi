BWAPI1 is a native API. Native APIs are timeless, being the most basic API choise in windows, it is not very hi-end or object oriented. If you're not searching for ridiculously high performance, use the BWAPI2 interface.

Methods:

  * [#BWGetVersion BWGetVersion]

=== BWGetVersion ===
int BWGetVersion();

Returns the SVN-revision number of the BWAgent.dll you're using.
