#summary Running multiple instances of Starcraft using ChaosLauncher

= Starcraft =

    _*Note*: It is generally not possible to run Starcraft as multiple instances without a hack, thus we have created a patch that will allow Starcraft to have multiple instances of itself and have a unique description in ChaosLauncher._

After copying the contents of _*starcraft-folder\*_ to your Starcraft folder, go to  _*\Starcraft\bwapi-data\*_ and run _*Multiple Instance Hack.bat*_.

The batch file will proceed to run an included patch file and create a new executable called _*StarCraft_MultiInstance.exe*_.


= ChaosLauncher =

After copying the contents of _*chaos-launcher-folder\*_ to your ChaosLauncher folder, you should run _*Chaoslauncher - MultiInstance.exe*_.

There is a drop-down menu that allows you to select the version you want to use. Click on it and select _*Starcraft Multi-Instance*_.

Select _*BWAPI Injector*_ and any other plugins you want to use. _*W-MODE*_ is also compatible and recommended with multiple instances.

Some plugins will be greyed out. Don't worry, this is normal behaviour. There is a checkbox available that will enable them.

= BWAPI =

To set up BWAPI for multiple instances, you must configure the AI path for each instance. Browse to _*Starcraft\bwapi-data\*_ and open _*bwapi.ini*_.

Now change the entries _*ai{{{_}}}dll{{{_}}}#*_ accordingly to load your AI modules.

When running with multiple instances, the original _*ai{{{_}}}dll*_ entry is ignored, and the _*ai{{{_}}}dll{{{_}}}#*_ entries specify which AI module belongs to which instance.

This is incomplete and has yet to be finished.
