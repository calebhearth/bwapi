= Starcraft =

    _*Note*: It is generally not possible to run Starcraft as multiple instances without a hack, thus we have created a patch that will allow Starcraft to have multiple instances of itself and have a unique description in Chaos Launcher._

After copying the contents of _{{{starcraft-folder\}}}_ to your Starcraft folder, go to  _{{{\Starcraft\bwapi-data\}}}_ and run _{{{Multiple Instance Hack.bat}}}_.

The batch file will proceed to run an included patch file and create a new executable called _{{{StarCraft_MultiInstance.exe}}}_.


= Chaos Launcher =

    _*Note*: It is also not possible for the default Chaos Launcher to support the launching of multiple instances, thus we included a hacked version that does._

After copying the contents of _{{{chaos-launcher-folder\}}}_ to your Chaos Launcher folder, you should run _{{{Chaoslauncher - MultiInstance.exe}}}_.

There is a drop-down menu that allows you to select the version you want to use. Click on it and select _{{{Starcraft Multi-Instance}}}_.

Select _{{{BWAPI Injector}}}_ and any other plugins you want to use. _{{{W-MODE}}}_ is also compatible and recommended with multiple instances.

Some plugins will be greyed out. Don't worry, this is normal behaviour. There is a checkbox available that will enable them.

= BWAPI =

To set up BWAPI for multiple instances, you must configure the AI path for each instance. Browse to _{{{Starcraft\bwapi-data\}}}_ and open _{{{bwapi.ini}}}_.

http://bwapi.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/multi_tut_05.gif

Now change the entries _{{{ai_dll_#}}}_ accordingly to load your AI modules.

When running with multiple instances, the original _{{{ai_dll}}}_ entry is ignored, and the _{{{ai_dll_#}}}_ entries specify which AI module belongs to which instance.

This is incomplete and has yet to be finished.
