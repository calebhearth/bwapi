UnitCommand objects are currently used only as arguments to one function - [Unit#issueCommand Unit::issueCommand]. While units can be issued commands the normal way via the [Unit] methods (i.e. [Unit#attackUnit Unit::attackUnit]), in some cases you may want to have a function that can process any unit command, such as when you're writing a proxy for BWAPI.
