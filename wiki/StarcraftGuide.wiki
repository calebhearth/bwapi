= Unit Cooldown Guide =
  == Which Cooldowns are activated? ==
    When a unit fires a weapon, both its air weapon and ground weapon cooldowns are set. It doesn't matter if the unit fires its air or ground weapon.
  == Why is the cooldown always different? ==
    Starcraft randomizes the cooldown.
    It takes the [WeaponTypes base cooldown] and adds a value between (-1) and (+2).

= Chance to Hit Guide =
  == Notes ==
    * No ground/doodad chance can be below 50%.
    * Hit chance only applies to ranged units.
    * Splash units will still do splash damage to units that are missed unless that unit is burrowed.
  == Chance to Hit from Low Ground to High Ground ==
    The chance to hit from low ground to high ground is roughly 50%. The unit has a 50% chance of missing the target.
    This includes from low ground to very high ground.
  == Chance to Hit Unit on Doodad ==
    Example: Behind a tree.
    The chance to hit units on a doodad is roughly 50%. The unit has a 50% chance of missing the target.
  == Chance to Hit Unit on the Same Level ==
    The chance to hit a unit on equal grounds is roughly 99.9%.
  == Chance to Hit Unit in Dark Swarm ==
    The chance to hit a unit inside of a Dark Swarm is 0%.

= Resource Gathering Guide =
  == Which Worker Gathers the fastest? ==
    All race's workers move the same. Their gathering speed is also the same.
    The only difference between the races is the size of their resource depot.
    Compare the sizes of [UnitTypes#Terran_Command_Center Terran Command Center], [UnitTypes#Protoss_Nexus Protoss Nexus], and [UnitTypes#Zerg_Hatchery Zerg Hatchery]/[UnitTypes#Zerg_Lair Lair]/[UnitTypes#Zerg_Hive Hive].
    Only the size of their resource depot impacts resource gathering time.
