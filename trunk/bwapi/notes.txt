I will describe the gather optimisation/latency issue later in the documentation
with pictures etc.

Mining test 8 mineral patches - 5 game minutes
Distance   = The distence of the mineral mined by co-miner to start spamming mineral
             to avoid the scv to pick another free mineral target, this could
             be optimised if I knew the the exact time the scv needs to come.
period     = The frame interval between spamming (affects the mining effectivity just 
             very little and saves tons of apm)
stopBefore = This one is solved: In how big advance should the scv stop spam 
             before the mineral will be free to mine from (it is equal to latency)

Test 1
Distance = Latency*3
period   = 4
Latency = BattlnetLow
------- -> ->
minerals = 3150
apm      = 280

    
Normal mining
minerals = 2624
apm      =    0
